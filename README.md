# Python_Pi_from_Sums
This notebook was written on 11/09/2023 as a self-assignment to train a little my skills in algorithm writing.

It aims to calculate the value of pi using an infinite sum and it was inspired by a video on series by Mathologer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO2A6I3Woos&t=1258s).

It's copyright free, you can download it from its GitHub project page at https://github.com/RAGilardi/Python_Pi_from_Sums/.

This complete notebook was written in one session, so the code won't probably be completely optimized and there might be minor errors. If you have any suggestions, please write them in the issue session of the GitHub project at https://github.com/RAGilardi/Python_Pi_from_Sums//issues.
